#+TITLE: nixos-options

This is my package.  It is nice.  You should try it.  Still work in progress.
Currently it depends on pandoc for the docbook->markdown conversion, on nix for
information retrieval and on alejandra for formatting nix code.

* COMMENT Installation
** Nix
This repo is a nix flake.  You can just add ~overlays.default~ output to your
nixpkgs overlays.

#+begin_src nix
{
  inputs.package-name.url = "github:xFA25E/package-name";
  outputs = { self, package-name, nixpkgs }: let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = "your-system";
      overlays = [ package-name.overlays.default ];
    };
  in {
    # YOUR OUTPUTS
  };
}
#+end_src

** Package manager
If you've installed it with your package manager, you're done.  ~package-name~
is autoloaded, so you can call it right away.

** Manual
Install these required packages:

+ foo
+ bar

Put /package-name.el/ in your load-path, and put the following in your init
file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'package-name)
#+END_SRC
